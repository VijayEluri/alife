/**
 * <p>Title: QuasiMetric</p>
 * <p>Description: Represents a quasimetric. A quasimetric satisfies the following conditions:</p>
 * <p>d(x,y) >= 0</p>
 * <p>d(x,x) = 0</p>
 * <p>d(x,y)=0 -> x = y</p>
 * <p>d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)</p>
 * <p>if it satisfies d(x,y) = d(y,x) then it is called metric</p>
